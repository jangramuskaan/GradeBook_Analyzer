# GradeBook Analyzer

GradeBook Analyzer is a Python-based command-line application that analyzes the performance of a predefined group of students. The program calculates class statistics, assigns grades, separates pass and fail students, and displays the results in a neat tabular format. A simple menu is included to allow repeating the analysis without restarting the program.

## 1. Project Description

This project evaluates student marks and provides useful performance insights.  
It uses a stored dictionary containing student names and marks, eliminating the need for manual entry.  
The program calculates average, median, highest, and lowest scores, assigns letter grades, and categorizes students based on pass or fail criteria.
